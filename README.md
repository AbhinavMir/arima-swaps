# ARIMA on Swaps

This project uses time series forecasting to predict future trading frequency in Uniswap data. The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains all the data used in the project, split into `raw/` and `processed/` folders for raw and preprocessed data respectively. It also contains a `models/` folder to store trained models.

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling and evaluation.

- `src/`: Contains Python modules for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

- `requirements.txt`: Contains a list of Python packages required to run the project.

## Setup

Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python modules to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build and evaluate the forecasting models.
